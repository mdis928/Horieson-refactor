# Horieson-refactor

The goal of this of this homework was to clean up the code. To do this we needed to use semantic elemants and not non-semantic elements. The visual webpage itself, didn't need to change. 
Here are some of the following changes that were made;

- I changed the title name to Horiseon
- Within the body, there are too many divs. 
- I replaced the "div" with a "header" and included a "nav".
- I made sure that the <header> was still linked properly to Style.CSS.
- As I moved down on the html, there is a lot of <divs>. Reading https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp, I felt the best semanctic element was to use "main" and "section". 
- I cleaned this section up and then, and also added a alt= and id= to the images.
- I also noticed each class= for each sction had its own class, I cleaned up the CSS so that we we only needed one. 
- Each section was the same (blue background, a header, and a paragraph)
- Then I moved down in the html and the next part looked like am "aside". 
- I then adjusted CSS for the aside section.
- I also added alt= and id= to the images.
- I updated the footer sections of the webpage
- I also made the position relative in "main" and "aside"
